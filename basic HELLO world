In this chapter you will learn about starting with c++.
* **Starting with including a Header file** 
   #include<stdio.h>
   **[it refers to stamdard input output header file which defines some macros and basic functions].**
   #include<iostream.h>
   **[this refers to an input output header file which includes the cout and cin objects derived from it.]**
   **here,void main() means that a function may pass no. of arguments but does not return a value.**
   void main()
   { 
    int x=0;
    **[this is used to initialize some variable x with value 0]**
    cout<<" \n enter a new number";
    **[This is a object of class ostream]**
    cin>>int y;
    **[This is a object of class istream]**
    getch();
    **[it returns the output to the console.]**
    }
